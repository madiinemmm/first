      Andijan is one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts
      of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th
      centuries. Historically, Andijan was an important city on the Silk Road.
      The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Babur who, following a
      series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal
      dynasty in the Indian subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor.
      Andijan also gained notoriety in 2005 when government forces opened fire
      on protestors, killing hundreds in what came to be known as the Andijan
      Massacre. Andijan was developed into an important industrial city during
      the Soviet era. Manufactured goods produced in the city include chemicals,
      domestic appliances, electronics, foodstuffs, furniture, plows, pumps,
      shoes, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and
      wheelchairs.
