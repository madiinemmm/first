      The first recorded settlers in what is now Uzbekistan were Eastern Iranian
      nomads, known as Scythians, who founded kingdoms in Khwarazm, Bactria, and
      Sogdia in the 8th–6th centuries BC, as well as Fergana and Margiana in the
      3rd century BC – 6th century AD.[13] The area was incorporated into the
      Iranian Achaemenid Empire and, after a period of Greco-Bactrian rule, was
      ruled by the Iranian Parthian Empire and later by the Sasanian Empire,
      until the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century.
