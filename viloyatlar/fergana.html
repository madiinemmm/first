      Fergana first appears in written records in the 5th-century. However,
      archeological evidence demonstrates that the city had been populated since
      the Chalcolithic period. Like many other Central Asian places in the sixth
      and seventh-centuries, Fergana was ruled by the Western Turkic Khaganate.
      Although it was still predominantly inhabited by eastern Iranians, many
      Turks had also started to settle there.[3] The city of Fergana was
      refounded in 1876 as a garrison town and colonial appendage to Margilan
      (22 kilometres or 13+1‚ÅÑ2 miles to the northwest) by the Russian
      Empire.[citation needed]
